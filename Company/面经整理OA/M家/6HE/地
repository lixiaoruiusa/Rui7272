第一题：
There are two wooden sticks of lengths A and B respectively. Each of them can be cut
into shorter sticks of integer lengths. Our goal is to construct the largest possible
square. In order to do this, we want to cut the sticks in such a way as to achieve four
sticks of the same length (note that there can be some leftover pieces). What is the
longest side of square that we can achieve?
Write a function:
def solution(A, B)
that, given two integers A, B, returns the side length of the largest square that we can
obtain. If it is not possible to create any square, the function should return 0.
Examples:
1. Given A = 10, B = 21, the function should return 7. We can split the second stick into
three sticks of length 7 and shorten the first stick by 3.
2. Given A = 13, B = 11, the function should return 5. We can cut two sticks of length 5
from each of the given sticks.
3. Given A = 2, B = 1, the function should return 0. It is not possible to make any square
from the given sticks.
4. Given A = 1, B = 8, the function should return 2. We can cut stick B into four parts.

第二题
A game of dominos consists of 28 domino tiles. Between 0 and 6 dots appear at each
end of every tile. Tiles can be reversed during the game, so the tile showing
"2-3"
can
be played as "3-2".
You are given a list of N unique domino tiles. Your task is to find any domino tile not on
the list and return it in the format "X-Y", where X and Y are digits representing the
number of dots on each end of the tile. Note that because domino tiles can be reversed,
tiles "2-3" and "3-2" are treated as the same tile.
Write a function:
func Solution(A []string) string
that, given an array A of N strings representing unique domino tiles, returns a string
representing any tile which is not in the array A. Tiles in A are given in the format
described above. You can assume that there will always exist a tile not listed in A
Examples:
1. Given A = "O-0", "O-1", "2-3", "2-0"], one of the possible outputs is "0-3". Note that
"1-0" is not a valid answer, as "0-1" represents the same tile.
2. Given A = "O-0", "1-1", "2-2", "3-3" "4-4', "5-5" "6-6'), one of the possible outputs is
"2-4"
第三题
An infrastructure consisting of N cities, numbered from 1 to N, and M bidirectional
roads between them is given. Roads do not intersect apart from at their start and end
points (they can pass through underground‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‍‍ tunnels to avoid collisions).
For each pair of cities directly connected by a road, let's define their network rank as the
total number of roads that are connected to either of the two cities.
Write a function:
def solution (A, Br N)
that, given two arrays A, B consisting of M integers each and an integer N, where Ali
and Blil are cities at the two ends of the i-th road, returns the maximal network rank in
the whole infrastructure.
Examples:
1. Given A = [1, 2, 3, 3], B = [2, 3, 1, 4] and N = 4, the function should return 4. The chosen
cities may be 2 and 3, and the four roads connected to them are: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3,
4)

Fair Index
给 A 和 B 两个长度都是 N 的数组，返回 fair index 的个数。每个数组从 index K 劈成两部分，四部分的和相等，K 就是 fair index。
sum(A[0]+A[1] + …… + A[K-1]),
sum(A[K] + A[K+1] + …… + A[N-1]),
sum(B[0]+B[1] + …… + B[K-1]),
sum(B[K] + B[K+1] + …… + B[N-1]) 这四个 sum 相等。
A = [A0, A1, A2, A3]
B = [B0, B1, B2, B3]
如果 A0 + A1 = A2 + A3 = B0 + B1 = B2 + B3，2 就是 fair index
Example：
A = [0, 4, -1, 0, 3]，B = [0, -2, 5, 0, 3]，有 3 和 4 两个 fair index，所以 return 2；
A = [2, -2, -3, 3]，B = [0, 0, 4, -4]‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‍‍，只有 2 一个 fair index，所以 return 1；
A = [4, -1, 0, 3]，B = [-2, 6, 0, 4]，没有 fair index，所以 return 0；
A = [3, 2, 6]，B = [4, 1, 6]， return 0；
A = [1, 4, 2, -2, 5]，B = [7, -2, -2, 2, 5] 有 2 和 4 两个 fair index，return 2。

Next integer does not contain two identical consecutive digits
https://leetcode.com/discuss/int ... or-SDE-1-or-OA-2022
https://leetcode.com/discuss/int ... -Digit-manipulation
Given integer N, find the smallest larger number that doesn't have the same two digits in consecutive positions.
Example: N = 76.
Answer: 78. Explanation -> 77 is the smallest larger number after 76 but hence we havedigit 7 in two consecuitive positions, that doesn't satisify our condition.
Note:N=766 -> answer should be 767, the number digits don't need to be unique, only they have not to be in consecutive positions.
You are given a positive Integer N, your task is to find the next smallest integer greater than N that does not contain two identical consecutive digits
ex: N=1765 -> 1767 beause 1766 has two identical consecutive digits
N=54 -> 56 not 55 because two identical digits

There are N cities. Cities are connected by roads .(Basically given a graph). K of the cities has a hospital(Given an array of size K). Time taken to reach a hospital from a city is no of edges to the nearest city which contains a hospital. Find the maximum time taken to reach a hospital from all the N cities.

Maximum pair sum
Question1: Given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum.
if there are not two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.
Constraints: N is integer within the range [1, 200000]
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1, 1000000000]
Example1:
Input:
A = [51, 71, 17, 42]
Output: 93
Explanation: There are two pairs of numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum: (51, 42) and (17, 71), The first pair sums up  to 93
Example2:
Input:
A = [42, 33, 60]
Output: 102
Explanation: The digits of all numbers in A add up the same sum, and choosing to add 42 and 60 gives the result 102
Example3:
Input:
A = [51, 32, 43]
Output: -1
Explanation: All numbers in A have digits that add up to different, unique sums

/* Given a string s, find the minimum number of substrings you can create
* without having the same letters repeating in each substring.
* Example:
* world -> 1, as the string has no letters that occur more than once.
    dddd -> 4, as you can only create substring of each character.
    abba -> 2, as you can make substrings of ab, ba.       
    cycle-> 2, you can create substrings of (cy, cle) or (c, ycle)

Palindrome creation
https://leetcode.com/discuss/int ... or-OA-or-MaximumSum
You are given a string S, which consists entirely of decimal digits (0−9).
Using digits from S, create a palindromic number with the largest possible decimal value.
You should use at least one digit and you can reorder the digits.
A palindromic number remains the same when its digits are reversed; for instance, "7", "44" or "83238".
Any palindromic number you create should not, however, have any leading zeros, such as in "0990" or "010".
For example, decimal palindromic numbers that can be created from "8199" are:
"1", "8", "9", "99", "919" and "989".
Among them, “989” has the largest value.
Write a function:
class Solution { public String solution(String S); }
that, given a string S of N digits, returns the string representing the palindromic number with the largest value.
Examples:
1. Given "39878", your function should return "898".
2. Given "00900", your function should return "9".
3. Given "0000", your function should return "0".
4. Given "54321", your function should return "5".
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
string S consists only of digits (0−9).
